# Multi-Agent Collaboration POC

A proof-of-concept implementation of **intelligent agent collaboration** where AI agents work together to build and maintain a shared knowledge base, with automatic validation to ensure consistency and quality.

## ü§î **The Problem**

### **Why Do We Need Multi-Agent Collaboration?**

Imagine you're building a tourism recommendation system. You have different AI agents that specialize in different tasks:

- **Agent A** finds and processes hotel information
- **Agent B** collects restaurant reviews and ratings  
- **Agent C** analyzes tourist attractions and amenities
- **Agent D** detects contradictions and inconsistencies

**The Challenge**: How do you make these agents work together without creating conflicts, contradictions, or duplicate information?

### **Real-World Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Conflicting Information**
- Agent A says "Hotel X is family-friendly"
- Agent B says "Hotel X is not family-friendly"
- **Problem**: Which agent is correct? How do we resolve this?

#### **Scenario 2: Incomplete Data**
- Agent C finds a new restaurant but has no rating
- Agent D needs ratings to classify restaurants
- **Problem**: How do agents share information and build on each other's work?

#### **Scenario 3: Quality Control**
- Agent A processes 1000 hotels but some have invalid data
- Agent B adds ratings but some are outside valid ranges
- **Problem**: How do we ensure all data meets quality standards?

## üéØ **POC Concepts & Ideas: What It Does & Why It's Important**

2. Validator Gateway validates staging graphs
3. Valid changes move to consensus graph
4. Validator Gateway validates consensus against main
5. Valid consensus data commits to main graph
6. All agents see updated knowledge
```

### **Architecture Components Explained**

#### **ü§ñ LLM Agents with Domain Knowledge**

**What they do:**
- **Process Raw Data**: Take natural language input like "Dubai Aquarium is great for families"
- **Apply Domain Knowledge**: Use tourism ontology (9 classes, 10 properties) to understand context
- **Generate Structured Facts**: Create precise RDF triples like `tourism:DubaiAquarium rdf:type tourism:FamilyFriendlyAttraction`
- **Propose Changes**: Add new facts to their staging graph for validation

**How they work:**
- Each agent has access to the complete tourism domain schema
- Agents understand relationships between classes (e.g., CoastalCity ‚Üí City)
- Agents use correct properties (hasRating, locatedIn, hasAmenity)
- Agents create domain-compliant RDF that passes validation

#### **üìä Staging Graphs (Agent Workspaces)**

**What they are:**
- **Private Workspaces**: Each agent has its own isolated staging graph
- **Proposed Changes**: Contains facts the agent wants to add to the knowledge base
- **Safe Testing**: Agents can experiment without affecting others

**Example Staging Graph (Agent A):**
```turtle
# Agent A's proposed hotel facts
tourism:MarinaPlaza rdf:type tourism:Hotel .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasName "Marina Plaza" .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasRating 4.2 .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasAmenity "Pool" .
```

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Creation**: Agent starts with empty staging graph
2. **Population**: Agent adds proposed facts
3. **Validation**: Staging graph is checked against consensus + main
4. **Decision**: Valid facts move to consensus, invalid ones are rejected
5. **Cleanup**: Staging graph is cleared for next iteration

#### **ü§ù Consensus Graph (Agreed Knowledge)**

**What it is:**
- **Validated Contributions**: Contains facts from all agents that passed validation
- **Pre-Commit State**: Intermediate storage before final commit to main graph
- **Collaborative Building**: Represents agreed-upon knowledge from multiple agents

**Example Consensus Graph:**
```turtle
# Validated facts from multiple agents
tourism:MarinaPlaza rdf:type tourism:Hotel .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasName "Marina Plaza" .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasRating 4.2 .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasAmenity "Pool" .

tourism:CoastalBistro rdf:type tourism:Restaurant .
tourism:CoastalBistro tourism:hasName "Coastal Bistro" .
tourism:CoastalBistro tourism:hasRating 4.5 .
tourism:CoastalBistro tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .

# Derived facts from reasoning
tourism:MarinaPlaza rdf:type tourism:FamilyFriendlyHotel .
tourism:CoastalBistro rdf:type tourism:CoastalRestaurant .
```

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Accumulation**: Valid facts from multiple agents accumulate
2. **Integration**: Facts are integrated with existing consensus data
3. **Validation**: Consensus graph is checked against main graph
4. **Decision**: Valid consensus commits to main, invalid consensus rolls back
5. **Commit**: Validated facts move to main graph

#### **üèõÔ∏è Main Graph (Production Knowledge)**

**What it is:**
- **Authoritative Data**: The final, production knowledge base
- **Complete Relationships**: All validated facts and their relationships
- **Reasoning Results**: Includes derived facts from SWRL reasoning rules
- **Agent Access**: All agents read from and contribute to this graph

**Example Main Graph:**
```turtle
# Complete production knowledge base
tourism:MarinaPlaza rdf:type tourism:Hotel .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasName "Marina Plaza" .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasRating 4.2 .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .
tourism:MarinaPlaza tourism:hasAmenity "Pool" .
tourism:MarinaPlaza rdf:type tourism:FamilyFriendlyHotel .

tourism:CoastalBistro rdf:type tourism:Restaurant .
tourism:CoastalBistro tourism:hasName "Coastal Bistro" .
tourism:CoastalBistro tourism:hasRating 4.5 .
tourism:CoastalBistro tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .
tourism:CoastalBistro rdf:type tourism:CoastalRestaurant .

# All existing knowledge
tourism:Dubai rdf:type tourism:CoastalCity .
tourism:DubaiAquarium rdf:type tourism:Attraction .
tourism:DubaiAquarium tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .
# ... (all other validated facts)
```

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Acceptance**: Validated consensus data is accepted
2. **Integration**: New data is integrated with existing main graph
3. **Reasoning**: SWRL rules are applied to derive new insights
4. **Validation**: Final validation ensures no contradictions
5. **Publication**: Updated knowledge is available to all agents

#### **üîç Validator Gateway (Central Control)**

**What it does:**
- **Staging Validation**: Checks each agent's proposed changes against existing data
- **Consensus Validation**: Ensures consensus graph is consistent with main graph
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevents invalid or contradictory data from entering the system
- **Rollback Protection**: Automatically rolls back failed changes

**How it works:**
1. **Agent-Level Validation**: Each staging graph is validated against consensus + main
2. **Consensus-Level Validation**: Consensus graph is validated against main before commit
3. **Multi-Layer Checks**: SHACL validation + SWRL reasoning + consistency checking
4. **Automatic Rollback**: Failed validations trigger automatic rollback

### **üîÑ How Data Flows Through the System**

#### **Step 1: Agent Processing**
```
Raw Input: "Dubai Aquarium is great for families"
         ‚Üì
Agent with Domain Knowledge:
- Understands tourism ontology

         ‚Üì
Result: ‚úÖ Commit to main or ‚ùå Rollback
```

#### **Step 5: Main Graph Update**
```
Valid Consensus ‚Üí Main Graph
- Add validated facts to production
- Apply SWRL reasoning rules
- Derive new insights (e.g., FamilyFriendlyAttraction)
- Make knowledge available to all agents
```

### **Key Benefits**

1. **No Conflicts**: All agents see the same information
2. **Quality Control**: Every piece of data is validated before being added
3. **Automatic Reasoning**: The system can detect contradictions and create new insights
4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents build on each other's work
5. **Isolation & Safety**: Agent changes are validated in isolation before integration
6. **Consistency Assurance**: Multi-layer validation ensures data consistency
7. **Rollback Protection**: Failed validations don't corrupt the knowledge base

## üèóÔ∏è **How It Works: The Architecture**

### **Step 1: Agents Process Information with Domain Knowledge**

Each agent takes raw information and converts it into structured facts using comprehensive domain knowledge:

```
Raw Text: "Dubai Aquarium is a family-friendly attraction with a 4.6 rating"
         ‚Üì
Domain-Aware Processing:
- Agent has access to tourism ontology (9 classes, 10 properties)
- Agent understands domain relationships and constraints
- Agent creates precise, domain-compliant RDF
         ‚Üì
Structured Facts:

```

### **Step 2: Multi-Layer Validation Flow**

#### **Layer 1: Agent-Level Validation (Staging)**
```
Agent A proposes changes ‚Üí Staging Graph A
                        ‚Üì
Validator Gateway:
1. Merge staging + consensus + main graphs
2. Check agent consistency
3. Validate against existing data
4. Detect contradictions
                        ‚Üì
‚úÖ Valid ‚Üí Move to consensus
‚ùå Invalid ‚Üí Reject with detailed feedback
```

#### **Layer 2: Consensus/Main Validation (Pre-Commit)**
```
Consensus Graph (validated agent contributions)
                        ‚Üì
Validator Gateway:
1. Check consensus/main consistency
2. Final validation before commit
3. Rollback if conflicts detected
                        ‚Üì
‚úÖ Valid ‚Üí Commit to main graph
‚ùå Invalid ‚Üí Rollback consensus changes
```

#### **Layer 3: Final Integration (Main Graph)**
```
Main Graph (production knowledge base)
                        ‚Üì
All agents see updated knowledge
Reasoning engine derives new insights
SHACL validation ensures quality
```

### **Step 3: Validation Details**

#### **Check 1: Data Quality (SHACL Validation)**
- Are ratings between 0-5?
- Are required fields present?
- Are data types correct?

#### **Check 2: Logical Consistency (SWRL Reasoning)**
- Does this create contradictions?
- Can we derive new insights?
- Are there conflicting facts?

#### **Check 3: Agent Consistency**
- Does this conflict with what other agents have added?
- Is this consistent with existing knowledge?

### **Step 3: Collaborative Intelligence**

The system automatically:
- **Detects Contradictions**: "Agent A says X is family-friendly, Agent B says X is not family-friendly"
- **Creates New Insights**: "If X is coastal and family-friendly, then X is a coastal family destination"
- **Maintains Quality**: Only valid, consistent information is kept

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **The Knowledge Base: RDF/OWL**

We use **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** - a standard way to represent knowledge that both humans and machines can understand:

```
Example RDF Facts:
- Dubai rdf:type City
- Dubai isCoastal true
- DubaiAquarium rdf:type Attraction
- DubaiAquarium locatedIn Dubai
- DubaiAquarium hasRating 4.6
```

### **Validation Rules: SHACL**

**SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)** defines what "good data" looks like:

```
Example SHACL Rules:
- All attractions must have a name
- Ratings must be between 0 and 5
- Cities must have a country
- Entry fees must be positive numbers
```

### **Reasoning Rules: SWRL**

**SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language)** defines logical relationships:

```
Example SWRL Rules:
- IF attraction has playground AND city is coastal 
  THEN attraction is coastal family destination

- IF attraction is family-friendly AND not family-friendly 
  THEN this is a contradiction
```

### **The Reasoning Engine: Apache Jena**

**Apache Jena** is a powerful reasoning engine that:
- Applies SWRL rules to find new insights
- Detects logical contradictions
- Maintains consistency across all data

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key (for AI agents)

### **Setup and Run**
```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key

# 2. Start the system
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Initialize the knowledge base
python scripts/init_fuseki.py

# 4. Run the demo
python unified_demo.py
```

## üß™ **Demo: See It In Action**

The demo shows two types of validation:

### **Logical Validation (No AI Required)**
- ‚úÖ Valid data passes all checks
- ‚ùå Invalid data is rejected
- ‚ùå Contradictions are detected
- ‚ùå Missing information is flagged

### **AI Agent Collaboration**
- ü§ñ Agents process natural language
- ü§ñ Agents collaborate to build knowledge
- ü§ñ Agents detect contradictions intelligently
- ü§ñ Agents understand context and meaning

## üß† **Dynamic Domain Awareness: LLM Agents with Ontology Knowledge**

### **The Challenge: How Do AI Agents Understand Domain Knowledge?**

Traditional AI agents often work with **limited domain knowledge** - they might know basic concepts but lack deep understanding of the specific domain they're working in. This leads to:

#### **‚ùå Problems with Limited Domain Knowledge**
```
Agent: "I found a great place in Dubai"
System: "What type of place? Hotel? Restaurant? Attraction?"
Agent: "It's a tourist spot with good ratings"
System: "What kind of tourist spot? What amenities does it have?"
Agent: "It's family-friendly and near the coast"
System: "Is it a CoastalAttraction? FamilyFriendlyAttraction? Both?"
```

**Problems:**
- **Vague Descriptions**: Agents use generic terms instead of domain-specific concepts
- **Inconsistent Classification**: Different agents classify the same entity differently
- **Missing Relationships**: Agents don't understand how entities relate to each other
- **Poor RDF Generation**: Generated facts don't follow the domain schema
- **Validation Failures**: Created data doesn't pass domain validation

#### **‚úÖ Our Solution: Dynamic Ontology Knowledge Extraction**

Our system provides LLM agents with **comprehensive, dynamic access to domain knowledge**:

```
üß† AGENT DOMAIN AWARENESS
======================================================================

üìä ONTOLOGY KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
============================================================
‚úÖ Classes: 9 tourism concepts
   - City, CoastalCity, Attraction, CoastalAttraction
   - FamilyFriendlyAttraction, NotFamilyFriendlyAttraction
   - CoastalFamilyDestination, Country, Contradiction

‚úÖ Properties: 10 domain-specific attributes
   - Object Properties: locatedIn, inCountry
   - Datatype Properties: hasName, hasRating, hasAmenity, isCoastal
   - Financial: hasEntryFeeAmount, hasEntryFeeCurrency
   - Demographics: hasMinAge, population

‚úÖ Relationships: Domain/range constraints
   - locatedIn domain: Attraction, range: City
   - hasRating domain: Attraction, range: decimal
   - isCoastal domain: City, range: boolean

‚úÖ Namespace: http://example.org/tourism#
‚úÖ Prefix: tourism
```

### **How Dynamic Domain Awareness Works**

#### **1. Automatic Ontology Extraction**
```python
def _extract_ontology_knowledge(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract comprehensive ontology knowledge for LLM agents."""
    # Extract classes from ontology graph
    classes = extract_classes_from_ontology()
    
    # Extract properties and relationships
    properties = extract_properties_from_ontology()
    relationships = extract_relationships_from_ontology()
    
    return {
        "classes": classes,
        "object_properties": properties["object"],
        "datatype_properties": properties["datatype"],
        "relationships": relationships,
        "namespace": "http://example.org/tourism#",
        "prefix": "tourism"
    }
```

#### **2. Enhanced LLM Prompts with Domain Knowledge**
```python
prompt = f"""
Parse the following tourism data and convert it to RDF Turtle format.

TOURISM ONTOLOGY KNOWLEDGE:
Classes: {', '.join(ontology_info['classes'])}
Object Properties: {', '.join(ontology_info['object_properties'])}
Datatype Properties: {', '.join(ontology_info['datatype_properties'])}
Relationships: {'; '.join(ontology_info['relationships'])}
Namespace: {ontology_info['namespace']}
Prefix: {ontology_info['prefix']}

Use the tourism ontology classes and properties listed above.
Create proper RDF triples with correct subject-predicate-object relationships.

Data: "Dubai is a coastal city with the Burj Khalifa attraction"

Return only the RDF Turtle format.
"""
```

#### **3. Domain-Aware RDF Generation**
**Before (Limited Knowledge):**
```
# Generic, vague RDF
tourism:Place1 rdf:type tourism:Entity .
tourism:Place1 tourism:hasProperty "good" .
tourism:Place1 tourism:hasLocation "Dubai" .
```

**After (Domain-Aware):**
```
# Precise, domain-compliant RDF
tourism:Dubai rdf:type tourism:CoastalCity .
tourism:Dubai tourism:hasName "Dubai" .
tourism:Dubai tourism:isCoastal true .

tourism:BurjKhalifa rdf:type tourism:Attraction .
tourism:BurjKhalifa tourism:hasName "Burj Khalifa" .
tourism:BurjKhalifa tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai .
tourism:BurjKhalifa tourism:hasRating 4.9 .
```

### **Key Benefits of Dynamic Domain Awareness**

#### **1. Precise Classification**
- **Correct Classes**: Agents use proper domain classes (CoastalCity, FamilyFriendlyAttraction)
- **Accurate Properties**: Agents use domain-specific properties (hasRating, isCoastal)
- **Valid Relationships**: Agents create correct subject-predicate-object triples

#### **2. Domain Compliance**
- **Schema Validation**: Generated RDF passes SHACL validation
- **Business Rules**: Agents follow tourism domain business logic
- **Consistency**: All agents use the same domain vocabulary

#### **3. Intelligent Understanding**
- **Context Awareness**: Agents understand tourism domain concepts
- **Relationship Recognition**: Agents see how entities relate to each other
- **Pattern Recognition**: Agents identify tourism patterns and trends

#### **4. Quality Assurance**
- **Validation Ready**: Generated data passes all domain validation
- **Consistency Maintained**: All agents use consistent domain terminology
- **Error Prevention**: Domain knowledge prevents common classification errors

### **Real-World Impact**

#### **Before: Generic AI Agents**
```
Input: "Dubai Aquarium is great for families"
Output: Generic RDF with vague classifications
Validation: ‚ùå Fails domain validation
Quality: ‚ùå Poor, inconsistent data
```

#### **After: Domain-Aware AI Agents**
```
Input: "Dubai Aquarium is great for families"
Output: Precise RDF using tourism ontology
- tourism:DubaiAquarium rdf:type tourism:Attraction
- tourism:DubaiAquarium tourism:hasAmenity "Playground"
- tourism:DubaiAquarium tourism:locatedIn tourism:Dubai
- tourism:DubaiAquarium rdf:type tourism:FamilyFriendlyAttraction (derived)

Validation: ‚úÖ Passes all domain validation
Quality: ‚úÖ High-quality, domain-compliant data
```

## üîÑ **Multi-Agent Collaboration: Facts-Only Communication**

### **The Key Innovation: Structured Communication**

Most multi-agent systems allow agents to communicate in **free text** (natural language), which creates several problems:

#### **‚ùå Problems with Free Text Communication**
```
Agent A: "I found a great hotel in Dubai, it's really nice and has good reviews"
Agent B: "What hotel? What reviews? How nice is 'really nice'?"
Agent C: "I also found a hotel, it's the best one, definitely recommend it"
Agent D: "Which hotel is better? How do I compare them?"
```

**Problems:**
- **Ambiguity**: "Great hotel" - which one? What makes it great?
- **Inconsistency**: Different agents use different terms
- **No Validation**: Can't check if information is accurate
- **No Reasoning**: Can't derive new insights from text
- **No Quality Control**: Can't ensure data standards

#### **‚úÖ Our Solution: Facts-Only Communication**

Our system forces agents to communicate only through **structured facts**:

```
Agent A: 
- Hotel_DubaiMarina rdf:type Hotel
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasRating 4.5
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Pool"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina locatedIn Dubai

Agent B:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Spa"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPrice 250.0
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPriceCurrency "USD"

System automatically detects:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Pool" AND "Spa"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina is LuxuryHotel (derived from amenities)
```

### **Why Facts-Only Communication Works Better**

#### **1. Unambiguous Information**
- **Clear Structure**: Every fact has a subject, predicate, and object
- **No Interpretation**: "Rating 4.5" is always 4.5, not "good" or "nice"
- **Precise Relationships**: "Hotel X hasAmenity Pool" is unambiguous

#### **2. Automatic Validation**
- **Data Quality**: Every fact is checked against rules
- **Consistency**: System detects conflicting facts automatically
- **Completeness**: Missing required information is flagged

#### **3. Automatic Reasoning**
- **New Insights**: System derives "LuxuryHotel" from amenities
- **Contradiction Detection**: System finds conflicting ratings
- **Pattern Recognition**: System identifies trends and relationships

#### **4. Collaborative Building**
- **Shared Understanding**: All agents see the same structured data
- **Incremental Knowledge**: Each agent adds specific facts
- **Quality Assurance**: Only validated facts are accepted

### **Comparison: Traditional vs Facts-Only**

| **Aspect** | **Traditional Multi-Agent** | **Facts-Only System** |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Communication** | Free text messages | Structured RDF facts |
| **Validation** | Manual review | Automatic validation |
| **Consistency** | Human oversight | Automatic detection |
| **Reasoning** | Limited | Full logical reasoning |
| **Quality** | Variable | Guaranteed standards |
| **Scalability** | Difficult | Easy to scale |

### **Real Example: Hotel Information**

#### **Traditional Approach (Free Text)**
```
Agent A: "Found a nice hotel in Dubai Marina, it's got a pool and spa, 
         rated 4.5 stars, costs around $250 per night"

Agent B: "I also found a hotel in Dubai Marina, it's excellent, 
         has great facilities, highly rated, expensive but worth it"

Agent C: "There's a luxury hotel in Dubai Marina, very expensive, 
         top-notch amenities, perfect for families"
```

**Problems:**
- Which hotel is which?
- What's the exact rating?
- What amenities does it have?
- How do we compare them?

#### **Facts-Only Approach (Structured)**
```
Agent A:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina rdf:type Hotel
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasRating 4.5
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Pool"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Spa"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPrice 250.0
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPriceCurrency "USD"

Agent B:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Restaurant"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Gym"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina isFamilyFriendly true

Agent C:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Concierge"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Valet"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina isLuxuryHotel true
```

**Benefits:**
- **Clear Information**: Exact ratings, prices, amenities
- **Automatic Validation**: All facts checked for quality
- **Automatic Reasoning**: System derives "LuxuryHotel" from amenities
- **Collaborative Building**: Each agent adds specific information
- **Quality Assurance**: Only valid, consistent facts are kept

## üéØ **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **1. Quality Assurance**
- Every piece of information is validated
- Contradictions are automatically detected
- Data quality is maintained at all times

### **2. Collaborative Intelligence**
- Agents work together, not in isolation
- Each agent builds on others' work
- The whole system is smarter than individual agents

### **3. Automatic Reasoning**
- The system finds new insights automatically
- Relationships are discovered and maintained
- Complex patterns are detected

### **4. Dynamic Domain Awareness**
- **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Agents have full access to domain ontology
- **Precise Classification**: Agents use correct domain classes and properties
- **Schema Compliance**: Generated data passes all domain validation
- **Context Understanding**: Agents understand domain relationships and constraints

### **5. Scalability**
- Add new agents easily
- Add new types of information
- Scale to larger knowledge bases

### **6. Facts-Only Communication**
- **Unambiguous**: No interpretation needed
- **Validated**: Every fact is checked
- **Reasoned**: System derives new insights
- **Collaborative**: Agents build shared knowledge

## üîß **Technical Implementation: Dynamic Domain Awareness**

### **How It Works Under the Hood**

#### **1. Ontology Knowledge Extraction**
```python
def _extract_ontology_knowledge(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract comprehensive ontology knowledge for LLM agents."""
    ontology_graph = self.ontology.get_ontology_graph()
    
    # Extract classes from RDF/OWL ontology
    classes = []
    for s, p, o in ontology_graph.triples((None, RDF.type, OWL.Class)):
        if str(s).startswith("http://example.org/tourism#"):
            classes.append(str(s).split("#")[-1])
    
    # Extract properties and relationships
    object_properties = extract_object_properties(ontology_graph)
    datatype_properties = extract_datatype_properties(ontology_graph)
    relationships = extract_domain_range_relationships(ontology_graph)
    
    return {
        "classes": sorted(classes),
        "object_properties": sorted(object_properties),
        "datatype_properties": sorted(datatype_properties),
        "relationships": relationships,
        "namespace": "http://example.org/tourism#",
        "prefix": "tourism"
    }
```

#### **2. Enhanced LLM Prompt Generation**
```python
def _create_enhanced_prompt(self, data: str) -> str:
    """Create LLM prompt with comprehensive domain knowledge."""
    ontology_info = self.ontology_knowledge
    
    return f"""
    Parse the following tourism data and convert it to RDF Turtle format.

    Prefix: {ontology_info['prefix']}
    
    Use the tourism ontology classes and properties listed above.
    Create proper RDF triples with correct subject-predicate-object relationships.
    
    Data: {data}
    
    Return only the RDF Turtle format.
    """
```

#### **3. Domain-Aware Validation**
```python
def validate_domain_compliance(self, rdf_data: str) -> bool:
    """Validate that generated RDF follows domain ontology."""
    # Parse generated RDF
    graph = Graph()
    graph.parse(data=rdf_data, format="turtle")
    
    # Check against SHACL shapes
    shacl_result = self.shacl_shapes.get_validation_report(graph)
    
    # Check against ontology constraints
    ontology_compliance = self._check_ontology_compliance(graph)
    
    return shacl_result["conforms"] and ontology_compliance
```

#### **4. Graph Lifecycle Management**

- **Finance**: Financial agents monitoring markets and risks
- **Education**: Educational agents creating learning materials

## üìû **Getting Started**

1. **Run the Demo**: See the system in action
2. **Explore the Code**: Understand how agents work
3. **Add Your Own Agents**: Create agents for your domain
4. **Extend the Knowledge Base**: Add new types of information

## üéâ **Conclusion**

This system demonstrates how **AI agents can collaborate intelligently** while maintaining **data quality and consistency**. It's not just about individual AI agents - it's about creating a **collaborative intelligence system** where agents work together to build and maintain shared knowledge.

### **Key Innovations:**

1. **Dynamic Domain Awareness**: LLM agents have comprehensive access to domain ontology knowledge, enabling precise classification and domain-compliant data generation.

2. **Facts-Only Communication**: Agents communicate through structured facts rather than free text, ensuring unambiguous, validated, and reasoned information exchange.

3. **Multi-Layer Validation**: Every piece of information is validated through SHACL shapes, ontology constraints, and SWRL reasoning rules.

4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents work together to build shared knowledge, with each agent contributing specific domain expertise while maintaining overall consistency.

The key insight: **Intelligent collaboration requires both AI capabilities AND rigorous validation** to ensure quality and consistency in the shared knowledge base. **Dynamic domain awareness** ensures that AI agents understand and work within the specific domain constraints, while **facts-only communication** ensures that all information exchange is precise, validated, and reasoned.
