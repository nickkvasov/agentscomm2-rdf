# Multi-Agent Collaboration POC

A proof-of-concept implementation of **intelligent agent collaboration** where AI agents work together to build and maintain a shared knowledge base, with automatic validation to ensure consistency and quality.

## ü§î **The Problem**

### **Why Do We Need Multi-Agent Collaboration?**

Imagine you're building a tourism recommendation system. You have different AI agents that specialize in different tasks:

- **Agent A** finds and processes hotel information
- **Agent B** collects restaurant reviews and ratings  
- **Agent C** analyzes tourist attractions and amenities
- **Agent D** detects contradictions and inconsistencies

**The Challenge**: How do you make these agents work together without creating conflicts, contradictions, or duplicate information?

### **Real-World Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Conflicting Information**
- Agent A says "Hotel X is family-friendly"
- Agent B says "Hotel X is not family-friendly"
- **Problem**: Which agent is correct? How do we resolve this?

#### **Scenario 2: Incomplete Data**
- Agent C finds a new restaurant but has no rating
- Agent D needs ratings to classify restaurants
- **Problem**: How do agents share information and build on each other's work?

#### **Scenario 3: Quality Control**
- Agent A processes 1000 hotels but some have invalid data
- Agent B adds ratings but some are outside valid ranges
- **Problem**: How do we ensure all data meets quality standards?

## üí° **The Solution: Shared Knowledge Base with Validation**

### **Core Concept: Agents Share a Common "Brain"**

Instead of agents working in isolation, they all contribute to and read from a **shared knowledge base** (like a shared database that understands relationships and meaning).

```

### **Key Benefits**

1. **No Conflicts**: All agents see the same information
2. **Quality Control**: Every piece of data is validated before being added
3. **Automatic Reasoning**: The system can detect contradictions and create new insights
4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents build on each other's work

## üèóÔ∏è **How It Works: The Architecture**

### **Step 1: Agents Process Information**

Each agent takes raw information (like text, reviews, data) and converts it into structured facts:

```
Raw Text: "Dubai Aquarium is a family-friendly attraction with a 4.6 rating"
         ‚Üì
Structured Facts:
- Dubai Aquarium is an Attraction
- Dubai Aquarium has rating 4.6
- Dubai Aquarium is family-friendly
- Dubai Aquarium is located in Dubai
```

### **Step 2: Validation Before Adding**

Before any agent can add information to the shared knowledge base, it goes through multiple checks:

#### **Check 1: Data Quality (SHACL Validation)**
- Are ratings between 0-5?
- Are required fields present?
- Are data types correct?

#### **Check 2: Logical Consistency (SWRL Reasoning)**
- Does this create contradictions?
- Can we derive new insights?
- Are there conflicting facts?

#### **Check 3: Agent Consistency**
- Does this conflict with what other agents have added?
- Is this consistent with existing knowledge?

### **Step 3: Collaborative Intelligence**

The system automatically:
- **Detects Contradictions**: "Agent A says X is family-friendly, Agent B says X is not family-friendly"
- **Creates New Insights**: "If X is coastal and family-friendly, then X is a coastal family destination"
- **Maintains Quality**: Only valid, consistent information is kept

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **The Knowledge Base: RDF/OWL**

We use **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** - a standard way to represent knowledge that both humans and machines can understand:

```
Example RDF Facts:
- Dubai rdf:type City
- Dubai isCoastal true
- DubaiAquarium rdf:type Attraction
- DubaiAquarium locatedIn Dubai
- DubaiAquarium hasRating 4.6
```

### **Validation Rules: SHACL**

**SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)** defines what "good data" looks like:

```
Example SHACL Rules:
- All attractions must have a name
- Ratings must be between 0 and 5
- Cities must have a country
- Entry fees must be positive numbers
```

### **Reasoning Rules: SWRL**

**SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language)** defines logical relationships:

```
Example SWRL Rules:
- IF attraction has playground AND city is coastal 
  THEN attraction is coastal family destination

- IF attraction is family-friendly AND not family-friendly 
  THEN this is a contradiction
```

### **The Reasoning Engine: Apache Jena**

**Apache Jena** is a powerful reasoning engine that:
- Applies SWRL rules to find new insights
- Detects logical contradictions
- Maintains consistency across all data

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key (for AI agents)

### **Setup and Run**
```bash
# 1. Set up environment

```

## üîÑ **Multi-Agent Collaboration: Facts-Only Communication**

### **The Key Innovation: Structured Communication**

Most multi-agent systems allow agents to communicate in **free text** (natural language), which creates several problems:

#### **‚ùå Problems with Free Text Communication**
```
Agent A: "I found a great hotel in Dubai, it's really nice and has good reviews"
Agent B: "What hotel? What reviews? How nice is 'really nice'?"
Agent C: "I also found a hotel, it's the best one, definitely recommend it"
Agent D: "Which hotel is better? How do I compare them?"
```

**Problems:**
- **Ambiguity**: "Great hotel" - which one? What makes it great?
- **Inconsistency**: Different agents use different terms
- **No Validation**: Can't check if information is accurate
- **No Reasoning**: Can't derive new insights from text
- **No Quality Control**: Can't ensure data standards

#### **‚úÖ Our Solution: Facts-Only Communication**

Our system forces agents to communicate only through **structured facts**:

```
Agent A: 
- Hotel_DubaiMarina rdf:type Hotel
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasRating 4.5
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Pool"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina locatedIn Dubai

Agent B:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Spa"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPrice 250.0
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPriceCurrency "USD"

System automatically detects:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Pool" AND "Spa"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina is LuxuryHotel (derived from amenities)
```

### **Why Facts-Only Communication Works Better**

#### **1. Unambiguous Information**
- **Clear Structure**: Every fact has a subject, predicate, and object
- **No Interpretation**: "Rating 4.5" is always 4.5, not "good" or "nice"
- **Precise Relationships**: "Hotel X hasAmenity Pool" is unambiguous

#### **2. Automatic Validation**
- **Data Quality**: Every fact is checked against rules
- **Consistency**: System detects conflicting facts automatically
- **Completeness**: Missing required information is flagged

#### **3. Automatic Reasoning**
- **New Insights**: System derives "LuxuryHotel" from amenities
- **Contradiction Detection**: System finds conflicting ratings
- **Pattern Recognition**: System identifies trends and relationships

#### **4. Collaborative Building**
- **Shared Understanding**: All agents see the same structured data
- **Incremental Knowledge**: Each agent adds specific facts
- **Quality Assurance**: Only validated facts are accepted

### **Comparison: Traditional vs Facts-Only**

| **Aspect** | **Traditional Multi-Agent** | **Facts-Only System** |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Communication** | Free text messages | Structured RDF facts |
| **Validation** | Manual review | Automatic validation |
| **Consistency** | Human oversight | Automatic detection |
| **Reasoning** | Limited | Full logical reasoning |
| **Quality** | Variable | Guaranteed standards |
| **Scalability** | Difficult | Easy to scale |

### **Real Example: Hotel Information**

#### **Traditional Approach (Free Text)**
```
Agent A: "Found a nice hotel in Dubai Marina, it's got a pool and spa, 
         rated 4.5 stars, costs around $250 per night"

Agent B: "I also found a hotel in Dubai Marina, it's excellent, 
         has great facilities, highly rated, expensive but worth it"

Agent C: "There's a luxury hotel in Dubai Marina, very expensive, 
         top-notch amenities, perfect for families"
```

**Problems:**
- Which hotel is which?
- What's the exact rating?
- What amenities does it have?
- How do we compare them?

#### **Facts-Only Approach (Structured)**
```
Agent A:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina rdf:type Hotel
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasRating 4.5
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Pool"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Spa"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPrice 250.0
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasPriceCurrency "USD"

Agent B:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Restaurant"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Gym"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina isFamilyFriendly true

Agent C:
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Concierge"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina hasAmenity "Valet"
- Hotel_DubaiMarina isLuxuryHotel true
```

**Benefits:**
- **Clear Information**: Exact ratings, prices, amenities
- **Automatic Validation**: All facts checked for quality
- **Automatic Reasoning**: System derives "LuxuryHotel" from amenities
- **Collaborative Building**: Each agent adds specific information
- **Quality Assurance**: Only valid, consistent facts are kept

## üéØ **Key Benefits of This Approach**
